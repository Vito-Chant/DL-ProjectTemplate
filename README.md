## Overview

DL-ProjectTemplate is designed to simplify the creation and management of deep learning projects. It includes essential components and best practices to ensure your project is organized and maintainable.

## Features

- Modular code structure
- Configuration management with YAML files
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model definition and training scripts
- Evaluation and logging
- Visualization tools

## Installation

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vito-Chant/DL-ProjectTemplate.git
cd DL-ProjectTemplate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Configuration: Customize the 'config.yaml' file to set up your project parameters.

2. Data Preparation: Place your dataset in the 'data/' directory. Modify the 'data_loader.py' to handle your specific data format.

3. Model Definition: Implement your model architecture in 'model.py'.

4. Training: Run the training script with your configuration:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

5. Evaluation: Use the evaluation script to assess your model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config.yaml
Visualization: Generate visualizations using the provided tools in visualization/.
```

6. Visualization: Generate visualizations using the provided tools in 'visualization/'.
